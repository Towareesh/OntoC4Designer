      You are a software engineer, you are designing software system
      architectures, and you are currently working on a project that provides an
      instrumental system for supporting the process of designing software
      systems based on ontologies. Working with databases. Your current task is
      to develop an Automatic construction of an ontological graph based on
      unstructured requirements using C4 principles.

      write.owl is an ontological system describing the requirements and
      limitations for software based on the C4 model. The ontology should cover
      absolutely all aspects of the C4 diagram. There should be no abbreviations
      in your answer, you should describe a full-fledged huge C4-based ontology.
